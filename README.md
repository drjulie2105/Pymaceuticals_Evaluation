# Pymaceuticals_Evaluation

> Evaluation of an animal study on the effects of different Drug Regimens for squamous cell carcinoma.  The study involved 249 mice over the course of 45 days treated with different Drug Regimens.  The tumor volume for each mouse was measured every 5 days over the course of those 45 days.  This evaluation focuses on the performance of the drug Capomulin vs three other drug regimens (Ramicane, Ceftamin and Infubinol).

>> Utilized Jupyter notebook, pandas and matplotlib in this evaluation.

>> Utilized boxplots and line graphs for visualization of the four drugs effect on tumor volume over the course of 45 days.

>> The top three final observations of the study are outlined under the heading of the Jupyter notebook.
